# EE 413 Project: Image Compression and Classification with Deep Learning

This project is part of the EE 413 - Applied Digital Signal Processing course at KFUPM (Spring 2025). It focuses on combining **wavelet-based image compression**, **compressed sensing**, and **deep learning** to analyze the effects of compression on image classification performance using the Mini-ImageNet dataset.
